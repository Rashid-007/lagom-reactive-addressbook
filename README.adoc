= Introduction
The application creates, update and queries contact data

= Tools/Framework
- Lagom as framework for reactive microservice development
- Cassandra as distributed/event driven storage

= Quickstart
To run:
```
$ mvn clean
$ mvn lagom:runAll

```

To remote debug
```
mvnDebug lagom:runAll
```
Then on IDE (i.e IntelliJ) use remote debugging in "Edit Configuration" with default
port number 8000 and module selected as the impl one from the listed modules.


= TODOs
Implement the read-side for refined queries.
Add Swagger API docs (not well supported yet like Spring Boot)
Async using Message broker api

= Notes
Only addressbook-api and addressbook-impl modules are relevant. Streaming modules will be considered for Async examples
